                            Jenkins is an automated deployment platform. It is the first choice of developers for creating
                            enterprise grade software. From extremely simple and small to large scale, highly complex
                            applications, Jenkins does it all. It follows a continuous delivery/continuous integration. At
                            Avidclan we leverage the power of Jenkins to create high performance software with complex
                            customizations and a highly flexible deployment environment.

                        Jenkins is a one of a kind object oriented programming language, and is super easy to learn and
                        implement. Developer community is very well versed with Jenkins and find it really easy to traverse
                        through bugs, new ideas with Jenkins. Making Jenkins development feature rich, and highly robust.

                        Jenkins not just offers an easy programming language but a highly scalable environment to work in. The
                        Jenkins platform takes into account the growth of the company, and is one of the easiest platforms to
                        work with for scalability. No matter how complex the software, at Avidclan we leverage the power of
                        Jenkins to create extensible, scalable apps.

                    <p>
                        Jenkins offers a great deal of flexibility. With Jenkins code reusability is a big boon, because any
                        module can be reused. And this is extremely helpful in highly complex, enterprise grade applications
                        where there is a lot of overlap. Following a clean coding environment, developers get a highly
                        flexible space to create nuanced solutions.
