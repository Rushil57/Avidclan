                                The overall cost depends on whether you plan to develop a single page application or a web portal.
                                The web application may cost more as it involves a lot of rendering and processing. In case you
                                are developing an application that integrates with the legacy system, it will cost more. Depending
                                on the functionality, feature, the performance requirements and the desired workflow, the app
                                costs will be determined.
