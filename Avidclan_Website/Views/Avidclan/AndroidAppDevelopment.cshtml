                            Android applications development is synonymous with mobile applications development. It is the best
                            choice for most startups and even enterprises to create mobile applications. Android was developed
                            by a consortium of developers and sponsored by Google. It is mostly open source but also has some
                            propriety applications from Google. At Avidclan, we create high-performance, extensible and secure
                            Android mobile applications customized for your business.

                                Android is designed for on-the-go cellular or smaller devices/screens. Therefore, the power
                                consumption has to be reduced to the minimum. Android manages memory to suspend operations when
                                any application is not in use. Also, it does not use battery power or CPU resources while any
                                application is not in use. On Android, the system invisibly and automatically starts closing

                                Android development generally follows a linear, code, build, test, sign and deploy life cycle.
                                With the deployment being synonymous with publishing. Here publishing is actually putting the
                                application on and android application store like Google Play. Regression testing, application
                                rating, targetted regions, size and more are few of the major facts considered while publishing.
