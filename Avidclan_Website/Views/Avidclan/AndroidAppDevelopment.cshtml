On Android, the system invisibly and automatically starts closing inactive processes."

Android apps run in an isolated area where the rest of the system doesn’t have automatic access to the applications, the user has to explicitly grant these permissions. This isolated area is called a sandbox. Android uses many such means to keep user data secure. And is constantly adding on to its security tech stack."

                                Android is designed for on-the-go cellular or smaller devices/screens. Therefore, the power
                                consumption has to be reduced to the minimum. Android manages memory to suspend operations when
                                any application is not in use. Also, it does not use battery power or CPU resources while any
                                application is not in use. On Android, the system invisibly and automatically starts closing
                                inactive processes.

                                Android applications offer a great deal of security with the support of an ecosystem. Android apps
                                run in an isolated area where the rest of the system doesn’t have automatic access to the
                                applications, the user has to explicitly grant these permissions. This isolated area is called a
                                sandbox. Android uses many such means to keep user data secure. And is constantly adding on to its
                                security tech stack.

                                Android development generally follows a linear, code, build, test, sign and deploy life cycle.
                                With the deployment being synonymous with publishing. Here publishing is actually putting the
                                application on and android application store like Google Play. Regression testing, application
                                rating, targetted regions, size and more are few of the major facts considered while publishing.
