                            Xamarin is an extension for mobile apps under the .NET ecosystem. Roughly put, .NET is a one-stop
                            shop for developers. Virtually any kind of application can be built with the .NET platform. It
                            offers tools, libraries languages to build apps. Xamarin is an extension within the .NET platform
                            that provides an ecosystem of libraries, tools, and languages specific for building mobile
                            applications. At Avidclan Technologies, we have been leveraging the power of Xamarin to build
                            solutions for Windows, iOS, and Android.

                        Xamarin is a highly preferable option for developers because it uses C# as a single language for
                        everything. And developers need not switch interfaces, everything can be done on Visual Basics.

                        Xamarin is a quite thorough platform. It has access to all native APIs across platforms, and toolkits
                        for iOS, Android, and Windows. Platform-specific elements like Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS,
                        Xamarin.Essentials, Xamarin.Forms all enable .NET developers to create high performance, native apps.

                        Xamarin offers one of the best platforms for a shareable, reusable code experience. A single code can
                        be virtually used anywhere and everywhere. And with just a few changes, it can be run on different
                        platforms with a native experience.

                        Since Xamarin offers a shareable coding environment and a single language tech stack, it is much

                                Xamarin offers complete binding for SDKs for both Android and iOS. These are robust,
                                strongly-typed and easy to use. The complete binding over underlying SDKs makes Xamarin less prone
                                to errors.
