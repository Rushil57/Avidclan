                        Flutter offers a consistent UI across platforms, and its cross-platform framework allows developers to
                        deliver and deploy apps on all platforms quickly. The rendering process offered by Flutter makes it
                        extremely easy to build apps that offer a native experience on all platforms.

                        cross-platform UI, it offers developers a go-to framework for creating native-looking applications.
                        Thus, creating a supportive environment for the application development community.

                        Since Flutter app development works on a single codebase, it saves developers hours of time. And with
                        an extensive library of widgets, it makes it super easy for app developers to simply pick and choose
                        what they like instead of creating new components.
