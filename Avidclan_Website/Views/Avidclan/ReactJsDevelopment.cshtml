                            React is a JavaScript Library. Hence, the JS. It was developed by Meta (then Facebook) in 2013 and
                            is still maintained by them. However, it is now available as an open-source resource. ReactJS is
                            essentially a front end web development. It is used to build interactive user interfaces. If you
                            come across a sophisticating looking website, like ours, it is probably built with React. Netflix,
                            Instagram, and Uber, are all built using React. At Avidclan Technologies, we hold a special place
                            in our skillsets for React, if you are looking to build an application with your dream UI, you are

                                ReactJS uses a Virtual DOM. To power its declarative API, instead of a real DOM, React makes
                                changes in the virtual DOM. A representation of sorts of the real DOM is kept in the memory. This
                                is known as the Virtual DOM. This is the virtual representation of the UI synced with the real
                                DOM. Objects here represent the UI. ReactDOM is a library that enables this sync.

                                Yes, being a power-packed front-end library, React offers users many options for creating
                                animations. React Transition Group, React Motion, React Spring, or Framer Motion can all be
                                leveraged to create animations in React.
