                            DevOps is when operations and development teams collaborate to improve the coding, enhance
                            development processes and accelerate time-to-market. Azure DevOps provides the platform for
                            developers, project managers, teams, decision-makers, and other important stakeholders to
                            collaborate and improve the delivered products.<br /><br />

                                practices.<br /><br />
                                1. Planning: It is important to start with the planning phase, where you identify the changes that
                                you need to make to the company before getting started. <br />
                                2. Automate Testing: you should test as early in development as possible tor emove the errors from
                                the root.<br />
                                3. Continuous Development: Incorporate the build-to-test model so that you are developing as you
                                test the model. <br />
                                4. Monitoring and Feedback: Continuously monitor the deployed application, receive and incorporate
                                the feedback, follow the loop and deploy the application changes.
