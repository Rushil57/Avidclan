1. Planning: It is important to start with the planning phase, where you identify the changes that you need to make to the company before getting started.
2. Automate Testing: you should test as early in development as possible tor emove the errors from the root.
3. Continuous Development: Incorporate the build-to-test model so that you are developing as you test the model.
4. Monitoring and Feedback: Continuously monitor the deployed application, receive and incorporate the feedback, follow the loop and deploy the application changes."

                            others. We use Azure DevOps to build a secure and scaling environment that can help improve the
                            app’s potential, remove the gaps between the development and operations team and accelerate time to

                                However, as the team size and the development process grows, you will need to invest in paid

                                practices.<br /><br />
                                1. Planning: It is important to start with the planning phase, where you identify the changes that
                                you need to make to the company before getting started. <br />
                                2. Automate Testing: you should test as early in development as possible tor emove the errors from
                                the root.<br />
                                3. Continuous Development: Incorporate the build-to-test model so that you are developing as you
                                test the model. <br />
                                4. Monitoring and Feedback: Continuously monitor the deployed application, receive and incorporate
                                the feedback, follow the loop and deploy the application changes.
