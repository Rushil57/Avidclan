                        Microsoft SQL Server is extremely easy to install, and integrate. Much like most other Microsoft
                        solutions, Microsoft SQL Server documentation and instructions are easy to understand by any layman.
                        This makes it highly popular amongst the market with a peculiar interface, and an interactive
                        ecosystem to work in.

                    <p>
                        Microsoft SQL Server is one of the most secure databases out there. With a high level of encryption
                        algorithms and multiple layers of security, it is extremely hard to crack MS SQL. Since Microsoft SQL
                        Server is not an open source server, the amount of attacks are significantly lower, and so is the
                        risk.

                    <p>
                        Microsoft SQL Server is quite cost-efficient given the data mining, disk partitioning and data
                        management tools it has to offer all under one roof. The integration capability and reduced cost of
                        operations make it an ideal choice for businesses looking for a secure, advanced database management
                        system.
